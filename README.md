# BackSav

## what is it? | 这是啥

A small script which auto backup sav files when you play games.
Some **GAMES** such as Wi*df**st with high death punish and no SL, this script can use to backup savs and help to SL so that you can play it relaxer.

这就是个给存档自动备份的脚本，防止某些游戏自动存档阻止你玩SL大法。

You can also use it by press **"Ctrl+P"** then it can backup the files you want to backup so that you can save manually.

你也可以按下**Ctrl+P**手动备份存档。

## how can you use it? | 怎么用？

By setting values in **settings.json**.
- file is a array of files you want to backup.
- dir is the directory where backup files saved(in file's base directory).
- max_files depends that how many backup will be saved. Every backup which exceed max_files number will be delete. 
- manual_file is a array of files when Ctrl+P pressed will be saved. Backups saved by press will not use max_files limit.

设置settings.json就行，我懒得写中文了，大多数选项应该是能看懂的吧？
